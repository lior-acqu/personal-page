                <p class="project-desc" style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.5; max-width: 750px;">Scalearn was created as my final project in high school. Intially, I hardly knew any technologies required to build a mobile app. By watching great tutorials and the approach of "Learning by Doing", which was very successful, I managed to learn and build every thing without any problems. In the end, I even got an award for my final project and the highest possible grade.</p>
                <p class="project-desc" style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.5; max-width: 750px;">What can it do? Scalearn is a mobile app that allows you to track your grades during your semesters. Apart from entering your grade, you can also add information about the way you have prepared for the test. With this data, Scalearn then creates statistics for you - to help you find the ideal preparation method for each of your exams.</p>
